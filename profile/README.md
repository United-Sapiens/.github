<p align="justify">The world has become quite chaotic and complicated in the last few decades, a total “bad vibe". After millennia of civilization we still have wars, massacres, genocides, heinous crimes, human rights violations, etc. In my view, we have forgotten the most important thing throughout history: <b>we are all Homo Sapiens, a single species and a single people</b>.</p>

<p align="justify">The main idea behind the <b>United Sapiens</b> initiative is to make citizens and governments aware that we need to evolve our way of thinking and acting. And the first step is to “stamp in our minds” that we are all Sapiens, without divisions of caste, gender, race, religion, fortune, ideology, etc. This also includes any other type of prejudice or any other form of discrimination. In addition, there are other important guidelines that deserve attention.</p>

- Stop all ongoing armed conflicts that are taking place around the world;
- End of the veto power of the five permanent members (China, United States, France, United Kingdom, Russia) in the United Nations Security Council;
- Recognition of the Security Council as the only official military alliance, for the benefit of all member countries of the United Nations;
- Termination of all current military alliances (e.g. NATO);
- Incorporation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights into the constitutions of all member countries of the United Nations;
- Maintenance of non-violent protests against existing dictatorial governments.

<p align="justify">As you can see, there is a lot to be done to make the world a better place. Anyone can contribute the way they can. You can also contribute if you are interested. Join the conversation on Twitter and Instagram. Criticism and suggestions are very welcome.</p>

## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/United-Sapiens/.github/main/assets/clamor-icon.png" height="18px">  United Sapiens' Clamor

<p align="justify">I created the <b>United Sapiens' Clamor</b>, a short introductory text in the form of a poem, an almost popular appeal, to make clear my way of thinking and what <b>United Sapiens</b> came to do.</p>

```
     WE ARE SAPIENS
     ONE SPECIES OF ONE PEOPLE
     TOGETHER WE'RE STRONGER
     UNITED WE'RE INVINCIBLE

     NO ONE SHALL EVER DIVIDE US
     BY CASTE, RACE OR RELIGION
     FOR WE ARE LEGION
     ONE FOR ALL AND ALL FOR ONE
```

<p align="justify">I've already created the <a href="https://www.united-sapiens.org" target="_blank">United Sapiens landing page</a>. There you can check out the <b>United Sapiens' Clamor</b> translated into many languages of many countries. I also make it clear that anyone can participate in the initiative, just send me an e-mail:&nbsp; <a href="mailto:united.sapiens.br@gmail.com">united.sapiens.br@gmail.com</a>.</p>
