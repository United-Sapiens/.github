<p align="justify">In recent decades, since its founding in 1945, the <b>United Nations</b> has been committed to finding peaceful solutions to diverse international conflicts and political rivalries. The enormous difficulty in achieving world peace is a reflection of the tribalist and conservative nationalism still held by nations, rather than a sensible foreign policy. You may have read or heard some of the following statements:</p>

-   France has no friends, only interests.
-   England has no eternal friends, England has no perpetual enemies, England has only eternal and perpetual interests.
-   The United States of America has no friends; have interests.
-   Nations have no permanent friends and no permanent enemies, only permanent interests.
-   Countries never become friends, it is their interest for what they pretend to be friend.
-   Men can have friends, statesmen cannot.

<p align="justify">The greatest threat facing the <b>United Nations</b> is the risk of being discredited, of becoming a front political organization and having the same fate as the <b>League of Nations</b>, which was created in 1919 but closed after three decades for not having fulfilled its main purpose of preventing wars. Several wars and conflicts have occurred since the founding of the <b>United Nations</b> as a result of the failure of negotiations.</p>

<p align="justify">I still have hope that we can achieve a state of world peace, without armed conflicts or political rivalries. However, I am fully aware that we are still very far from this ideal. We need to focus on ending dictatorial regimes, removing the military from these governments and restoring democracy in these nations. It would be an important step towards the progress of international relations.</p>

<p align="justify">The main idea behind the <b>United Sapiens</b> initiative is to make citizens and governments aware that we need to evolve our way of thinking and acting. In this sense, the first step is to "stamp in our minds" that <b>we are all human beings, without divisions of caste, gender, race, religion, fortune, ideology, etc</b>. This also includes any other type of prejudice or any other form of discrimination.</p>

<p align="justify">In addition, there are other important guidelines that deserve attention. Countries that surrender to dictatorial or fascist regimes are precisely those that harm international negotiations and cause conflicts. Also, the recent rise of far-right extremism in some nations poses a great risk to established democracies. The citizens of these nations need to be aware of the risk to which they are subject.</p>

<p align="justify">Knowledge of geopolitics is important to understand the real intention of certain fascist leaders, because they usually tend to act in a populist way at the beginning and evolve to authoritarianism after coming to power. Those nations who cannot remember the past mistakes of other nations are condemned to repeat them. An important activity that <b>United Sapiens</b> intends to carry out on this issue is to show people that geopolitics is everywhere — hence the intention to act on a global level.</p>
<br />

# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/United-Sapiens/.github/main/assets/global-goals.png" height="22px">&nbsp; Global Goals

<p align="justify">The <b>United Nations</b> still has a wide spectrum of problems to solve. In my opinion, the large number of deaths resulting from the ongoing wars and the constant influx of refugees make the following goals a priority:</p>

-   Eliminate the veto power of the five permanent members (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States) in the <b>United Nations Security Council</b>;
-   Make the <b>Security Council</b> the only official military alliance, for the benefit of the member countries of the <b>United Nations</b>;
-   Terminate all current military alliances (e.g., NATO);
-   Stop all the ongoing armed conflicts that are taking place around the world;
-   Dissolve existing dictatorial regimes and restore democracy in these nations;
-   Incorporate the <b>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</b> into the constitutions of all member countries of the <b>United Nations</b>.

<p align="justify">As you can see, there is a lot to be done to make the world a better place. Anyone can contribute in any way they can. You can also contribute if you are interested. You can contact me on any of the social networks below. Your comments and suggestions are always welcome.</p>

<p align="justify">The short text that I call <b>United Sapiens' Clamor</b>, in the form of a poem and with a popular appeal, is an allusion to the great potential that human beings could achieve if everyone united for peace, without divisions and without the need for wars. In my opinion, we have forgotten the most important thing throughout history:&nbsp; WE ARE ALL HOMO SAPIENS, A SINGLE SPECIES OF A SINGLE PEOPLE.</p>

```
     WE ARE SAPIENS
     ONE SPECIES OF ONE PEOPLE
     TOGETHER WE'LL BE STRONGER
     UNITED WE'LL BE INVINCIBLE

     NO ONE SHALL EVER DIVIDE US
     BY CASTE, RACE OR RELIGION
     OUR UNION WILL BECOME LEGION
     ONE FOR ALL AND ALL FOR ONE
```

<p align="justify">I've already created the <a href="https://www.united-sapiens.org">United Sapiens landing page</a>, to show the <b>United Sapiens' Clamor</b> translated into many languages ​​of many countries, to reinforce my way of thinking and to present the motto of <b>United Sapiens</b>. I also want to make it clear that anyone can participate in this initiative just by accessing the <a href="https://github.com/United-Sapiens/United-Sapiens.github.io">website repository</a> on GitHub.</p>
